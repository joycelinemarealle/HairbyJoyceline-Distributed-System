# HairbyJoyceline-Distributed-System

Hereâ€™s a distributed project outline for your HairbyJoyceline business, similar to the online banking system example you provided. This will involve creating an online platform for managing appointments, customer interactions, and services offered by the business.

Project: Distributed System for HairbyJoyceline
The system should enable users to book hair appointments, view available services, and manage appointments. The platform will be divided into three key components:

Customer Management
Appointment Scheduling
Service Listings
Functional Requirements
1. Customer Management:
Customer Registration:

A customer should be able to register, providing at least their name, email, and contact number.
After registration, they should receive a unique customer identification number (customer ID).
Customer Login:

Customers should be able to log in using their email or customer ID.
Once logged in, they can view their upcoming appointments and booking history.
Customer Profile:

Customers can update their contact details and view appointment history.
Profile should include their name, contact number, and a list of all appointments (past and future).
Delete Customer:

A customer can choose to delete their profile. Upon deletion, all their past appointments should be removed from the system.
2. Appointment Scheduling:
Booking an Appointment:

Customers can book an appointment by selecting a date and time from the available slots.
They must select a service from the list of offerings before confirming the booking.
Customers should be able to choose a specific stylist for the appointment.
Viewing Appointments:

Customers can view their booked appointments, including the date, time, stylist, and service details.
Canceling an Appointment:

Customers should be able to cancel an appointment.
Canceled appointments should be removed from the system, and the slot should become available again.
Stylist Management:

Admin (business owner) should be able to add or remove stylists.
Stylists should have profiles, including their available time slots, experience, and specialties.
3. Service Listings:
Service Catalog:

A list of available services (e.g., braiding, haircut, coloring) should be displayed on the platform.
Each service should have a description, duration, and price.
Service Search:

Customers should be able to search for services by type, price range, or stylist.
Service Addition (Admin Functionality):

The admin should be able to add or update services. This includes setting prices and availability.
Service Deletion:

Admin should have the ability to delete a service. If any customer has booked an appointment using the deleted service, the system should notify the customer of the change.

Non-Functional Requirements:
Scalability: The system should support high user traffic and multiple simultaneous appointment bookings.
Security: Implement secure login for customers and ensure that sensitive data (e.g., customer contact info) is encrypted.
Persistence: Data should be stored in a relational database, such as PostgreSQL.
Performance: The system should respond within 2 seconds for user requests.
Technologies to Use:
Backend: Java with Spring Boot for creating RESTful services.
Database: PostgreSQL for persistent storage of customer, appointment, and service data.
Frontend: React or Angular for the user interface.
Deployment: Use Docker for containerizing the backend and frontend services.
This project structure will help you provide an online platform for HairbyJoyceline that customers can use to manage appointments and view services.
